In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/codeobscure`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.\r\n\r\nTODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\ninstall it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install codeobscure\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n#### 版本说明\r\n* v0.1.2添加`-i`选项，执行这个选项会创建一个`ignoresymbols`文件，在这个文件中填写你要忽略的方法、属性或类名(英文逗号分割)。它仅仅作用于你的这个项目，和`-l`不一样，它不会被记录下来。假设你在`-l`过滤某些名称后，项目中仍然有某些名称冲突了，这个选项更方便你使用它，把冲突名称写入`ignoresymbols`，然后运行`-o`重新生成混淆文件。\r\n* v0.1.3 优化`-l`和`-o`的性能，提高运行速度\r\n* v0.1.4 放宽`ignoresymbols`的格式限制，字段之间以逗号分割即可，你可以为了可读性在字段之间添加空格换行等空白字符。例如\r\n\r\n\t\tv0.1.4之前必须如下，否则会过滤识别有问题：\r\n\t\t\t\tname,age,sex,nick\r\n\t\tv0.1.4版本:\r\n\t\t\t\tname, age ,sex,  nick \r\n\t\t\t   以及：\r\n\t\t\t   name,\r\n\t\t\t   age,\r\n\t\t\t   sex,\r\n\t\t\t   nick\r\n\t\t\t   \r\n\t\t这些方式都是可以的\r\n* v0.1.5 添加`NSClassFromString`以及`setValue:forKeyPath:`等字段过滤，进一步优化运行出现不识别方法崩溃的情况。添加替换方式[-t]，包括：随机字符 ， 随机单词，自定义替换(<font color=orange>目前自定义替换暂未实现，将在0.1.6中实现</font>)\r\n\t\r\n\t\t生成结果示例：\t\r\n\t\tr ：#define getHeight ZbgTCtOTDmEazebk\r\n\t\tw ：#define getHeight nodulatedBasutoland\r\n\t\tc ：等待实现\r\n注意：由于苹果反馈了如下的被拒信息,因为目前可以用w选项,之后会提供更有意义的单词的替换选项[c]：\r\n![被拒信息](./reject_inform.png)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n#### `codeobscure -h` for command help. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tUsage: obscure code for object-c project\r\n    -o, --obscure XcodeprojPath      obscure code\r\n    -l, --load path1,path2,path3     load filt symbols from path\r\n    -r, --reset                      reset loaded symbols\r\n    -f, --fetch type1,type2,type3    fetch and replace type,default type is [c,p,f].c for class,p for property,f for function\r\n    -i, --ignore XcodeprojPath       create a ignore file, you can write your filt symbols in it.eg:name,age ...\r\n\r\n\r\n-o [project file path], obscure for the project.    \r\n-l [path],load filt symbol path. if you don't want obscure code for some direcotry. you can use this option.    \r\n-r reset loaded filt symbols.\r\n-f, --fetch type1,type2,type3    fetch and replace type,default type is [c,p,f].c for class,p for property,f for function\r\n\r\n#### 使用及原理说明\r\ncodeobscure主要用于oc（目前来说由于swift的特性摆在那里，这种方式不适用于swift）的项目，利用[iOS安全攻防（二十三）：Objective-C代码混淆](http://blog.csdn.net/yiyaaixuexi/article/details/29201699)的方式去进行代码混淆,纯粹的娱乐自己恶心他人。\t\t\r\n\r\n此工具会默认遍历项目属性，方法和类名进行混淆。当然如果简单的进行遍历的话，会产生无穷无尽的错误，因为你不可能混淆苹果提供给你的官方API，也不能混淆framework和.a的静态编译的库。所以在混淆代码的时候必须排除掉它们。我已经帮你过滤了系统的方法。如果你的项目中使用Pod或者使用了静态库，或者其他比较特别的第三方库，请使用`codeobscure -l [路径1,路径2..]`的方式去过滤这些库文件。运行`codeobscure -o [项目名.xcodepro]`去调用混淆你的代码，然后耐心等待一会就可以了。\r\n\t\t\r\n当然并不意味这你运行了就一定没错误，该工具最大的简化了混淆代码的工作，由于不同的人编写的代码可能各不相同。假设你调用了`NSClassFromString(\"classNameA\")`而这个类正好被混淆了，它不识别classNameA到底是什么。那么怎么解决这个错误呢。最简单的方式就是在`codeObfuscation.h`中查询classNameA并删除它的#define即可。\t\t\r\n\r\n在0.1.3中，你并不要简单的删掉它，而是先运行`codeobscure -i XcodeprojPath`去生成`ignoresymbols`。然后把需要进一步过滤的某些名字直接添加进入，用英文逗号分隔开来。例如上面你要删除的，如果你仅仅是删除了，下次要执行`codeobscure -o`重新生成的时候会又重新生成，你要再次把它从`codeObfuscation.h`中查询出来并删除。v0.1.3中你仅仅添加到`ignoresymbols`就可以很方便的解决这一问题。下次`codeobscure -o`生成的时候回自动过滤到这些字段。\r\n\r\n我测试的项目是有打几年历史的一个项目，代码也挺多的。合理的过滤掉某些不应该混淆的方法。提示错误的仅仅只有一个地方,然后就是运行的时候有几处崩溃，都是因为方法被混淆了，不识别方法导致的，仅仅删除它就可以了。运行完成后，除了解决错误，你不需要进行额外的文件添加删除操作，我已帮你添加好了。你觉得代码混淆不好用，那么直接删除codeObfuscation.h就行了。此致，敬礼！\t\r\n\r\n\r\n注意：如果你运行了`codeobscure -l [路径1,路径2..]`,那么它会记录下来要过滤的东西。如果你下次不想过滤已经过滤的库，运行`codeobscure -r`来重置。\r\n\r\n如果有什么不好用的地方，直接写到issue，我会尽量让它更好用。\r\n\r\n`-l`可以接多路劲，用逗号分割，如下：\t\t\r\nExample :\r\n\r\n\tcodeobscure -o /Users/mac/Downloads/Examples/Messenger.xcodeproj  -l /Users/mac/Downloads/Examples/Pods,/Users/mac/Downloads/Examples/Download\r\n\r\n*注意:*  由于苹果新版系统有[SIP(系统完整性保护)](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT204899)默认是开启的，所以由于安装方式不同，可能在运行命令的时候出现:`attempt to write a readonly database (SQLite3::ReadOnlyException)`的问题。如果出现这个问题，请在命令行上加上`sudo`。\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/codeobscure.
